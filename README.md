# Usage

Go to the block you want to insert the table in, and type `/Parse CSV`. You will be prompted to upload the `csv` file. Just do so and click `Parse`. It's done completely local so no information leaves your computer.

# Installation

If not found in the marketplace, [download the latest release here](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-calview-plugin/releases) and manually load it into Logseq after unzipping it.
